- # EraseRacism
BMCC CSC 211H course Honors Project

- ## Inspiration For the Project:

Racial discrimination is a very sensitive topic and is directly connected to mental health and social growth. And especially in a diverse country like the USA, it is becoming very hard to stop racial discrimination. Since it is a diverse country everyone is expected to be treated equally and all should have equal rights in society. But American culture itself created a division between its residents, and the division is called white people and colored people. Even though all of us are living in the same country white people are considered colored people outsiders and the discrimination begins here. The act of racism always creates depression for the victim and it affects that person's mental health too. The act of racism is not only causing harm to the victim but also the society and the only way to end this toxic culture is to educate people about racial equality. In my project, I have tried to develop a game that will introduce the user to a different type of racial discrimination and it will also help them to distinguish between racial and non-racial activity.


- ## Project Description and Problem Statements:

EraseRacism is a game that will help players to be familiar with racism and they will be encouraged to prevent it. This game is been designed in a way that a player will be given a few situations where he has to choose non-racial comments or approaches over a set of racial approaches. This is a desktop game built with Qt framework and C++.

Since it is a quiz game I have set a list of questions that will be asked to the player as a challenge. All of the questions have a human picture from particular races and a description of the situation in which the player has to react. If the player reacts to the situation in a non-racial way then he will earn points. A player has to answer all the questions correctly to pass the game. 

This game can be useful for learning how to distinguish between racial and non-racial approaches. By playing this game one can become familiar with common intentional and unintentional racism, players can also realize if they are doing or facing racism in their everyday life. In my game after every question, a link to the source of the question is been given so that the player can learn more about racism.

**Resources: **  
I have used two racial Psychology-related articles to select questions for my game. They are:
1) The scholarly article called “Racial Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Implications for Clinical Practice. American Psychologist, 62, 4, 271-286” by Derald Wing Sue 

2) “Guide to Responding to Microaggressions” by Kavin L. Nadal published on CUNY FORUM 2:1 (2014) 71-76.

- ## Challenges and Solutions

1) First challenge I face was to decide which environment to choose for creating my project. At first I have choosed to use use SFML environment in order to create my application but after trying few days I realized SFML is a bit hard for me to learn in a short period of time. I discussed my Problem with Professor Azhar about it he suggested me to start with Qt application and this suggestion helped me to over come the first challenge.

2) The second and major challenge I faced is learning Qt frame work since it is quite different from what we learn in c++. But I after searching for a while I found a youtube tutorial playlist that helped me to learn Qt from scratch.

3) In the beginning of the project I wanted to create a game where a player will move and will meet random people from different races in random racial situation, and based on his reaction on the situation player will earn or lose points but due to my luck of knowledge about Qt, limited time and limited available resources I dropped my first idea. Finally I started planning for a quiz based game for my project and accomplished it.

- ## Accomplishments:

1. Succesfullly incorporated all major advanced programming techniques learnt in my 211H class.
2. Learnt QT framework

- ## Future Direction

Going forward I wolud like to update my game where a player will move around a city and will meet random people from different races in random racial situation, and based on his reaction on the situation player will earn or lose points
