# EraseRacism
BMCC CSC 211H course Honors Project

Project Description and Problem Statements: 

EraseRacism is a game that will help players to be familiar with racism and they will be encouraged to prevent it. This game is been designed in a way that a player will be given few situations where he has to choose non-racial comment or approach over a set of racial approach. This is a desktop game built with Qt frame work and C++.

Since it is a quiz game I have set a list of question that will be asked to the player as a challenge. All of the questions has a human picture from particular races and a description of situation on which the player have to react. If the player reacts on the situation in non-racial way than he will earn points. A player has to answer all the question correctly in order to pass the game. 

This game can be useful for learning how to distinguish between racial and non-racial approach. By playing this game one can become familiar with common intentional and unintentional racism, players can also realize if they are doing or facing racism in their everyday life. In my game after every question a link to the source of question is been given so that the player can learn more about racism.

Resources:   
I have used two racial Psychology related articles to select questions for my game. They are:
1) Scholarly article called “Racial Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Implications for Clinical Practice. American Psychologist, 62, 4, 271-286” by Derald Wing Sue 

2) “Guide to Responding to Microaggressions” by Kavin L. Nadal published on CUNY FORUM 2:1 (2014) 71-76.
