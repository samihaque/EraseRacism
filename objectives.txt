The game is created to introduce Racism.
Racism is a very sensitive topic and it
cause depression to the victims.
one can do racism intentionally or unintentionally.
As the society is becoming aware about racism
we are rejecting direct racism but most
of the time we are unaware about unintentional
racism and it can eventually result in becoming
direct racism. In this quiz I have tried to bring
the unintentional racism people do and tried to teach
which comment is racism and which comment is not.
Playing this game one can understand common racial
comment and identify them in their daily life.
